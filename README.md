# Maverick-Essentials-Android-App
Project Description: Maverick Essentials is an online platform for brick-and-mortar stores and supermarkets to connect with customers to sell their products in a quick and effective manner without having customers enter their store.
In a post-coronavirus world, this is important as large public gatherings in stores will not be feasible and that consumers should be able to purchase their items on-the-go without having to spend time in queues.
The project also aims to provide features such as Augmented Reality, Big Data Analytics, and Machine Learning in future releases.

Problem Statement: To develop an online application designed to help customers buy goods in a quick and easy manner and also develop brand exposure, store sales, and consumer analysis.

The motivation for Project:
1) The need for an application to improve brand visibility of everyday products associated with multiple sectors such as Grocery, Retail, Medicine, Entertainment, Luxury, etc.
2) Improvement of connectivity between multiple stakeholders such as retailers, distributors, brand organizations/producers, and daily customers through the use of an online application to increase speed and delivery of sales, data analytics to find best selling products and faster checkout of customers in billing queues.
